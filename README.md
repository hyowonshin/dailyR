# dailyR
Students in PS530 must submit "dailyR" assignments five times a week. Yes, that doesn't really match the name. If you want to submit one every day, feel free.  

Currently, we're still using the [google form](https://gist.github.com/drenn2/7b683e212cbbdbc188fc99746733f568), but you should try pushing some of your dailyR assignments onto this repository. I think that'd be cool! Just make a folder with your name and number your assignments.

# Examples and Ideas
I'm not going to post seven times a week, or even five, but check here and I'll provide some sample code semi-regularly. Sometimes the code will work and you should try adapting it; sometimes the code won't work and you should practice trouble-shooting. In short, it's inspiration or you can think about it like a mini-workshop.

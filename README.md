# dailyR
Students in PS530 must submit "dailyR" assignments five times a week. Yes, the name suggests that you should do this at least seven times a week.  

I'm not going to post seven times a week, or even five. I'll post less than that and I won't be posting working code. Instead, I'll provide a few ideas and some sample code that you can troubleshoot for days that you're wanting some more practice or need some inspiration.
